# How to Open .blend Files in Blender and .fbx Files in Paint 3D

## Opening .blend Files in Blender

1. Download and install Blender:  
   - Visit the official Blender website at https://www.blender.org/download/  
   - Download the appropriate version of Blender for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. Clone or download the GitHub repository:
   - Go to the GitHub repository where your .blend files are located.
   - Click on the "Code" button and select either "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a ZIP file or copy the repository's URL to clone it using Git.

3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file (if applicable):

   - Navigate to the location where you have the .blend file(s) stored, either the extracted folder from the ZIP file or the cloned repository.
   - Select the desired .blend file and click the "Open" button.
   - Blender will load the .blend file, and you can now view and edit its contents within Blender.

## Opening .fbx Files in Paint 3D

1. Ensure Paint 3D is installed:
   - Paint 3D comes pre-installed on Windows 10, so it should already be available on your computer.

2. Clone or download the GitHub repository:
   - Go to the GitHub repository where your .fbx files are located.
   - Click on the "Code" button and select either "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a ZIP file or copy the repository's URL to clone it using Git.

3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file (if applicable):
   - If you downloaded the repository as a ZIP file, extract its contents to a location on your computer.

4. Open the .fbx file in Paint 3D:
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the repository or the specific .fbx file you want to open.
   - Right-click on the .fbx file and select "Open with" from the context menu.
   - Choose "Paint 3D" from the list of available programs.
   - Paint 3D will import the .fbx file, and you can now view and work with the model in the Paint 3D interface.

You can now explore and modify your .blend files in Blender and view your .fbx files in Paint 3D. Enjoy working with your 3D models!
